# Sample STL Files

This directory contains sample STL files for testing Utopia 3D Studio.

## Files:

- **cube_sample.stl** - Simple cube geometry (12 triangles)
- **pyramid_sample.stl** - Pyramid with square base (8 triangles)
- **tetrahedron_sample.stl** - Basic tetrahedron (4 triangles)
- **eiffel_base_sample.stl** - Eiffel Tower base structure (12 triangles)

## Usage:

1. Drag and drop these files into the Utopia 3D Studio interface
2. Use them to test volume calculations, dimension measurements
3. Practice manipulation tools (rotation, scaling, coloring)
4. Export modified versions as new STL files

## Features to Test:

- ✅ File upload (drag & drop or file picker)
- ✅ 3D visualization and navigation
- ✅ Volume calculation accuracy
- ✅ Dimension measurements
- ✅ Object manipulation
- ✅ Color customization
- ✅ STL export functionality
